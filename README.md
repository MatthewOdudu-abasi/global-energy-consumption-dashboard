![Screenshot 2025-06-26 011531](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ebd1db9-0e63-4196-a278-360aa63b3f25)



## 📘 Project Description

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of energy consumption patterns across countries, energy sources, and per capita usage. Built for sustainability researchers, energy analysts, and policymakers, it highlights the distribution and behavior of global energy usage to support data-informed decisions in infrastructure, climate policy, and resource allocation.

##  Problem Statement

Despite the global urgency surrounding climate change and sustainability, many regions still lack accessible, transparent insights into how energy is consumed across sectors and demographics. This project addresses that gap by visualizing comprehensive global energy data, enabling nuanced understanding of national consumption behavior, source dependency, and the relationship between economic development and energy demand.

## 🔁 Summary of Process

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Removed incomplete or blank records in Country, Year, and Energy Source fields
   - Converted numeric data from string formats to appropriate numeric types
   - Unified categories for renewable sources and fossil fuels under broader groupings
   - Added calculated fields: Per Capita Energy Use, Household Energy Use, and Year-on-Year Growth

2. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Designed modular visuals to show national and comparative metrics
   - Built slicers for Year, Energy Source, and Country to enable custom exploration
   - Used card KPIs and multi-layered graphs to simplify consumption insights

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Top Energy Consuming Countries**:  
  United States ranks highest, followed by United Kingdom and Japan. Brazil stands out with large household energy use relative to peers.

- **Household Energy Demand**:  
  Brazil and India show significantly higher residential energy loads, requiring attention for domestic energy reform.

- **Per Capita Energy Use**:  
  India, Germany, and Japan lead in energy consumed per person—indicating intense industrial and commercial usage.

- **Global Fuel Mix**:  
  Fossil fuels remain dominant, though renewable sources are growing gradually across several economies.

- **Trend Over Time**:  
  Fossil fuel usage fluctuates slightly but remains high overall. Renewables show positive upward momentum, albeit unevenly distributed across countries.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Promote residential energy efficiency programs in countries with high domestic energy demand, especially Brazil and India.
- Accelerate renewable energy investments and industrial electrification in countries like the US, Japan, and Germany.
- Develop policy and financial tools to help countries diversify their energy mix beyond fossil fuel dependency.
- Encourage nations to deploy public-facing energy dashboards to monitor clean energy adoption and engage stakeholders.
- Support per capita consumption reduction in developed economies through behavioral awareness and technology-driven usage tracking.
