## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores **global energy consumption trends** by country, region, and energy source using an interactive Power BI dashboard. It focuses on understanding how different nations consume energy, the dominance of fossil fuels versus renewables, and per capita usage over time.

The dashboard aims to support policy planners, environmental analysts, and researchers by providing **visual insights into the global energy landscape**.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Total Energy Consumption by Country**
- **Global Energy Source Breakdown** (Fossil Fuels, Renewables, Nuclear)
- **Yearly Trends in Energy Usage**
- **Top & Bottom Countries by Per Capita Consumption**
- **Energy Consumption by Region**
- **Custom Filters**: Country, Year, Region, Energy Type

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Initial cleaning was done in Excel:

- Removed records with missing or null values in key fields
- Standardized column names and formats
- Converted all numerical values to number format
- Grouped similar energy types under clearer categories (e.g., merging "Biofuels" into "Renewables")
- Created derived columns such as:
  - *Total Energy per Capita*
  - *Year-on-Year Growth Rate (%)*

## 📁 Dataset Details

- **Source:** [Your dataset source name or link]
- **Fields Included:** Country, Year, Energy Type, Energy Quantity, Region, Population (if included)
- **Date Range:** Multiple years (up to 2019/2020 if available)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **China, USA, and India** are the top three global energy consumers
- Fossil fuels still make up over **75%** of global energy usage
- **Germany and the Nordic countries** lead in renewable energy share
- **Developed countries** have higher per capita usage, while demand in emerging economies is rising rapidly
- Energy use in high-income nations is beginning to plateau, showing signs of efficiency or market saturation

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Support renewable energy expansion in developing economies through funding and partnerships
2. Implement stricter energy efficiency policies in high-consumption countries
3. Diversify national energy portfolios to reduce overreliance on fossil fuels
4. Promote awareness and make energy reporting more transparent
5. Leverage real-time monitoring tools to improve response and planning
